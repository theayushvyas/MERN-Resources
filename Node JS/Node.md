##INTRO
**Node JS is a javascript runtime to compile javascript code on the server side . it is not a framework or library it is a framework.**

Earlier JS code can only be compiled on browser . different browser supports different JS Engine like IE used Chakra , Firefox uses Spider Monkey and Chrome has v8.

So in 2009 **Ryan Dhal** developed node JS.

Node JS is a JS runtime based on  Google Chrome's v8 Engine(Because it is the fastest among all js engine) and written in c++.
